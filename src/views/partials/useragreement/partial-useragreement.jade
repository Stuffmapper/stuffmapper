		h2 Welcome to Stuffmapper!
		p These are Stuffmapper's terms of use (hang with us). We’ve made an effort to make it easy to take in the below information, as we understand most people zoom through terms of use statements.  At the start of each section, you'll see the main takeaway of the following portion. By using Stuffmapper, you agree to these terms and we will always tell you if we change them. These summaries are not legally binding, but they give you a brief version of the terms. Summaries appear highlighted at the start of each section.
		br
		p Stuffmapper is, an online interactive service that provides a platform for users to exchange free reusable and new items. As a social purpose corporation, Stuffmapper is able to focus its attention on its users and the community. Our goal is to provide a safe and convenient space for our users to find new homes for their belongings, while doing our part to limit the number of usable items that are sent off to landfills.
		p Please read these Terms of Use ("Agreement" or "Terms") carefully before using the website (the “Site”), mobile applications (the “Apps”), and other features or services (collectively, the “Services”) offered by Stuffmapper, SPC ("Stuffmapper"), as they govern your use of the Services. By using the Services in any manner, including but not limited to visiting or browsing the Site, you (the "user" or "you") agree to be bound by these Terms. 
		h3 1. License

If you don’t agree to be bound by the modified Terms, then please discontinue use of the Services immediately. Because our Services are evolving over time we may change or discontinue all or any part of the Services, at any time and without notice to you, at our sole discretion.
